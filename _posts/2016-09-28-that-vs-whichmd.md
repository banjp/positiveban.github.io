excerpt: 항상 헷갈리는 that과 which. 어떤 차이가 있을까?
--- 

영작을 할 때마다 헷갈리는 that과 which.  
언제 that을, 언제 which를 사용하는지 정리해보자.

1. Restrictive (that) vs. Unrestrictive (which)
한글로 하면 제한적 용법, 계속적 용법이라고 한다.  
that은 제한적 용법에 사용, which는 계속적 용법에 사용한다고 하는데, 아래 예문을 보자.

* Our house [that has a red door and green shutters] needs painting.
* Our house, [which has a red door and green shutters], needs painting. 

* The classrooms [that were painted over the summer] are bright and cheerful. 
* The classrooms, [which were painted over the summer], are bright and cheerful.
