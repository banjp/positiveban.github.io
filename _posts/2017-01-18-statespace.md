excerpt: "State space"
---

$$position: x, velocity: \\dot{x}$$

x and xdot are states,
'State space' can be defined as a set of all states that can be achieved by a system, and can be n-dimensional.

The states could have some physical meaning on it, such as position, velocity, angle, etc.

Why do we usually use this representation?
Knowning the state could be useful in control engineering.
